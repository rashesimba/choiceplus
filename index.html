          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <p class="lead">We are dedicated to providing the best care possible for our clients, supporting their families, and working with the health professionals involved in managing their wellbeing.
            Everything we do is designed to help people to live with their condition in their own home: even if they are very ill. Whatever service we provide, whether it’s practical support
            for one hour a week or round the clock care for more complex needs, we do it with respect and sensitivity. Request Care and Nursing was established in 1998 by a former district nurse and a highly experienced care worker.
            Their backgrounds and experience continue to define our approach.Their vision was for a cost-effective yet high quality service that gave clients independence and dignity.
            They also wanted to offer a service that went one step further than most other care agencies.
            We’ve achieved that vision through a team of senior experienced carers, who are trained to a high standard by our own in-house RGN nurses. Our carers are equipped to deal with all types of emergency and
            to support a variety of needs from specialist dementia care to tracheostomy and ventilator home management. Whatever your needs we have an appropriate level of service, delivered by carers and nurses who share our values and ethos.
            They are committed to providing genuine, flexible quality care that respects your needs and wishes.</p>
